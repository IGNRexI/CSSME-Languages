"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto01"	   "Welcome to Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio.\nThis training center has been created to help you learn basic movements.\nPlease follow the arrows on the floor to complete your mission.\nFirst, you'll learn about basic movements."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto02"	   "CSN:S is a 1st person shooting game in that your movements are centered around your perspective.\nYou can use the W, A, S, D keys to move forward, backward, left, and right.\nYou can also use a combination of two keys to move diagonally."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto03"	   "Next, you'll go to a room with obstacles."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto04"	   "You can't walk over the low obstacle you see before you.\nYou must use the Space key to jump over it."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto05"	   "You can jump over the obstacle in front of you.\nYou can also go through the space beneath the desk.\nPress the Ctrl key to duck down."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto06"	   "You can receive an accuracy bonus if you fire while ducking down so use this feature when it's difficult to hit an enemy."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto07"	   "The box you see in front of you is similar to the previous box but is taller.\nWhen you can't jump over an obstacle using a normal jump, you can use what is called the 'Duck Jump'."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto08"	   "The name Duck Jump comes from the fact that you'll be jumping and ducking at the same time.\nTo use Duck Jump, press the (Ctrl) key and hold immediately after using the (Space) key to jump.\nYou will not be able to reach the maximum height if you take your fingers off of the Ctrl key during the jump.."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto09"	   "Try using Duck Jump to jump over the box.\nThe Duck Jump is one of the most important skills to learn in Counter-Strike."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto10"	   "Next, you'll learn about how to climb ladders.\nLadders allow you to reach high locations safely and is very important when used to place yourself in strategically good locations."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto11"	   "To climb up a ladder, you must press and hold the Forward (W) key.\nTry climbing up the ladder."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto12"	   "Climbing down a ladder is done in the same way as going up.\nBut if you want to jump down in the middle, simply press the Jump (Space) button.\nBe careful though, since jumping from too high of a location will get you injured."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto13"	   "Next, you'll learn about using guns.\nGuns are the most important equipment in Counter-Strike and you'll need them wherever you go.\nTo fight the enemy in battle, you'll have to become comfortable using guns.\nPlease pick up the M4a1 on the table."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto14"	   "You can equip the M4a1 with a silencer by right-clicking the mouse.\nThe sound of gun fire will be decreased when a silencer is equipped.\nThis can be useful for sneak attacks."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto15"	   "Try firing at the targets in front of you.\nClick the mouse left button to fire your gun.\nWhen one target is destroyed, another target will appear.\nDestroy a total of 3 targets."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto16"	   "If controlling your firing is difficult, try timing out your shots at 2 to 3 shots each."
"CSO_TitlesTXT_tuto17"	   "All the targets have been destroyed.\nNow, you'll learn about how missions work in Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio.\nPlease go through the exit and board the elevator."

"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_trap"				 "The barrier at the construction site was unstable. Zombies broke through the barrier, and charged straight to us. Just when   
I thought it was over, I heard a great cry. Right when the cry sounded, the zombies stopped their attack and began to withdraw.\n\nWe heard the cry echoing again. This time, it sounded almost human. The voice of this 'Rex' spoke words we could not understand. Although we did not know who it was, we knew they were behind this disaster and subduing him would be our way out.\n\nI quickly moved survivors to the source of the voice at the top of the building. There was no time to waste. It will all be over soon.\n\n- From the notebook of scout commanding officer, Andrei, found by the rescue team."
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_lastclue"			"When we received the scout commanding officer's rescue request, we were dispatched into the operation area 2 days later. During our investigation around the intersection, we found the corpse of scout commanding offer Andrei, and the other troop members.\nIn the commanding officer's hand was a notebook that detailed the gruesome things they experienced as well as a hand-drawn map marking a particular location in the city. What on earth did he want to tell us?\nWe quickly cleaned up the scene and went to the location marked on the map.\n\n - From the journal of Signalman 'Felix' in the rescue team."		
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_chaos"			 "When the troops transporting the samples had left, those who remained followed the last clue and entered the laboratory. The laboratory was huge maze of connected underground passages. As soon as we started our underground investigation, we received urgent orders to retreat from Jiyoon Choi, the border troops commander.\n\nWhen we identified our location her demeanor suddenly changed, dropping communication with her superiors to cooperate with our investigation alone. Resuming the investigation was a violation of government orders, but in this place we had to accept her cooperation. What is it that she's looking for?\n\n- From the journal of Signalman 'Felix' in the rescue team."
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_deadend"			"You may have seen horrors in battle, but it was truly a living hell back then. The zombie's trap in Lost City was enough to annihilate an entire army. But our investigation team was brilliant enough to find that last clue!\nTracking it all the way to the laboratory's basement was foolish. If it weren't for that government commander, we probably would have been lost in the chaos.\n\nEveryone probably thinks that ends the story and that Dr. Rex was the only culprit, but there are more siege types. Now, I'll let you in on what the government's been protecting... Shall I tell you what I really saw at the dead-end? After killing the siege type Phobos, we chased after the two that escaped and ended up on that ominous road...\n\n- From an interview with an unidentified veteran, 14 months after the Lost City incident."

All you have to do is enjoy the game while being divided into two teams. The rules of the game are simple. The outpour of zombies will be the opposing team and you must survive longer than they do. The strong will survive and the weak will be food for the zombies. The Cube of Fate, where only one team can survive! What do you think? Isn't it marvelous? Alright! Please go and have some fun..."
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_trace"			"1 year following the Lost City incident.  Inside the helicopter over the Caribbean Sea\n\nHello? To the brave LS team! My name is Soi, I'm a Senior Researcher at the Aegis Institute. You will soon enter into the operation area.  As you know, the zombie forces have weakened after the Lost City incident, but there's no telling what kind of zombies Dr. Rex is creating. So the purpose of this mission is to find clues for data on Dr. Rex. Information on the operation area will be relayed to you in real-time. Good luck!\n\nWhen communication stopped and we received orders from the LS Team captain to mobilize, the Alpha Team soon began to parachute out. Strange cries were resonating from all around the jungle."
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_culvert"			"Shortly after tracking the wounded Dione.\n\nHello. This is Soi, the Senior Researcher at the Aegis Institute. Even though we lost the chance to capture the Dione, we have given it quite some damage. I've received orders from headquarters to take advantage of this situation and continue tracking. Though they prefer to have it captured alive, they say it's okay to kill it. Keep it up a little longer!\n\nAfter continuing their track, the LS Team found the Dione hidden in Groundwater and tried to capture it alive. However, the Dione senses this and hides itself in the darkness. Right then, a swarm of zombies started flooding toward the LS Team."
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_decoy"			"Briefing while equipping at Groundwater\n\nSoldiers, we've been badly harmed by the Dione. The souls of our dead comrades and innocent civilians are not able find peace. We must find that monster and get rid of it. Just as Researcher Soi instructed, we will lure him with the device used to lure zombies.  The Delta Team has finished equipping so they will move to the operation area first. Delta Team, build a defense barrier and prepare the luring device. When the Alpha Team equips, they will join the Delta Team and initiate operation. Everybody focus and don't fall, Over!\n\n1 hour after the Delta Team was dispatched to the operation area, the  
Alpha Team finished equipping. As soon as they were dispatched, it began to rain and the area was engulfed in an ominous atmosphere."
"CSO_Loading_Story_zs_angra"			"Briefing in front of the large facility that was mysteriously abandoned.\n\nSoldiers, we have finally reached its hideout. According to Researcher Soi, Dione has begun to mutate due to the effects of the Z-Virus and is in the state of a cocoon. We must kill it quickly while it is in this defenseless state. We must make sure to never let this devil of a monster out into the world. Everyone be prepared.\nOver!\n\nAfter the captain's briefing, the LS Team rushed into the building. But what they saw was something not far from the creation of a colossal devil."
"CSO_Loading_Story_hs_desertstorm"		"After our troops collected the Phobos corpse sample at the unknown facility, we rushed to transport it back to the base. I chose a detour route in order to avoid zombies and transport it safely. But not long after entering the desert, a pour of gunfire came down on us from above.\n\nAfter being unexpectedly attacked, we went inside a nearby ruin to protect the sample. From a quick glance, the enemy was a huge state-of-the-art army of many elite soldiers and large aircrafts. New enemies that are not zombies. Who and what are they?\n\n- From the journal of Transportation Support Commander 'Victor'."
"CSO_Loading_Story_hs_hellfire"			"Soldiers, you've persevered well until now. Though the enemy has withdrawn for now, they will be coming back soon to steal those samples. However, there is good news. Squad 3 from the Sandstorm operation area has just brought down the aircraft Comanche and obtained a recording device.\nThough we need more analysis, we've discovered that the enemy is the Vanguard Company. Squad 3 has passed through the Vanguard Company base and is expected to join us.\n\nSoldiers, let's hope for smooth cooperation with Squad 3. Tomorrow, we will face the enemy with our comrades.\n\nA recording of Captain's Victor's briefing."
"CSO_Loading_Story_hs_blaze"			"Norman, by the time you see this letter with your comrades, I will probably be rocking the railroads with 'Blaze'. Let me apologize that our free-agents ignored the rules.\n\nYou probably want to accept the Vanguard Company's request, but I think differently. I can't say the reason yet, but I assure that you won't return empty-handed. We're in negotiation talks with the government so we're expecting to secure better financial support than the Vanguard Company. Just trust me like you always have.. Then I'll tell you the rest of the story once I finish business...\n\n- From the multi-national mercenary 'Red Lizard', Jim"
"CSO_Loading_Story_hs_sidewinder"		"If Jim hadn't helped when drones suddenly attacked us during the airline transportation operation, we probably would have been destroyed.  
We've received intelligence that Norman, who used to be Jim's right-hand man, sold the mercenary army\n to the Vanguard Company and disappeared. When Jim heard that his army was attacked, his uneasiness was obvious.\n\nWe had moved to our destination to transport the sample, but the remaining Squad 3 reinforcements were to re-equip and be dispatched to the mercenary's army.\n\n- From the journal of Transportation Support Commander 'Victor'."
"CSO_Loading_Story_hs_mosque"			"The pitch-black river flows as if it can devour anything. The dim light of the temple across the river shines as if to appease the souls of our fallen comrades. I wonder if Captain Victor's transportation troops have escaped safely by now.\n\nI have no regrets about volunteering to stay behind and keep watch over the river so that the enemy cannot cross. I'm certain the other volunteers feel the same way. As long as we are here,\nthe enemy will not cross the river.\n\n- From the journal of a soldier who received a medal for distinguished military service in the future."
